# Minesweeper Project

This Project was bootstrapped with ReactJs.

# Projest Description

The memory game is a basic matching game to test the player's memory. In a deck of paired cards, the
player needs to match each pair to win the game. The benefit of this program is primarily in the
possibility to play the game alone, against a computer, without another person required to participate.
In this project, the goal is to create a grid of picture cards that can be flipped over and matched. If a
match is found, the cards stay flipped, if not, they will turn back. The game continues until all cards are
flipped. When all cards are flipped (all pairs are matched) the user is to be able to play the game on the
next level. The game is to have 4 levels.
